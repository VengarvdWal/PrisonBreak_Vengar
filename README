Hi David, 

This is my assignment.
There are some little bugs, but I just didn't have the time to fix them.

Some things are a little vague, so I will try to explain them. 

-You open the inventory with the "I" key.
-You can pick up certain item with Left Click if near. (This is a little buggy for some reason, so try to aim a little higher.)

-The second door works, but it only opens when the ISS is close enough to your location. So if you don't want to wait I added a little
button on the doorframe. Left Clicking it well, load the next scene. 

In the next scene you need to pick up the glowing crystals, there are 3 of them.
You can check how many you have in your inventory.

Once you have collected all crystal you can now interact with the portal device on the map. 
(This hitbox is also pretty buggy, but it works eventually.)


I hope this clarifies somethings.
